# Real_Time_Twitter_Trends_Analysis
This project is a full-stack application that utilizes React.js for the frontend and Node.js
with Express for the backend. The main objective is to provide real-time analysis of Twitter trends based on location. 
The Twitter API V 1.1 is employed to retrieve the latest trends for a specific place, 
utilizing the WOEID (Where On Earth ID) system to identify different locations.

By leveraging React.js for the frontend, we aim to create an interactive and user-friendly interface that displays the trending
topics. The Node.js backend will handle API requests and data processing, ensuring accurate and up-to-date trend analysis. 
This project offers valuable insights into current Twitter trends and serves as a useful tool for trend analysis enthusiasts.

## Install dependencies
Install the dependencies first by going into individual folders, i.e., frontend and backend using npm install individually

## Run the application
use npm run dev inside the project root folder to start the both applications, frontend React will run on PORT=3000 and backend express will run on PORT=4000
